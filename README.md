# Tic-Tac-Toe
It is a game well knowned by everyone.
I know that this project is not to be called as major project but what new in this is the design part.
Although all might not agree with the design part but i still feel like it is best way of representing my frontend skill.
About the game:- The game is played between two people , where one is X and the other one is O.
When all the columns or rows of same symbole i.e either X or O is matched ,the person is the winner.
